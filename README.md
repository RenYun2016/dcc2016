##Note
Due to the limitation on uploading, we separate our RESULTS AND DATABASE file (around 360MB, including the eye-tracking database, original images, and the compressed images by the three approaches) into 18 files with smaller size (each around 20MB). So please try to download all of these files and then unzip them into a single file.
